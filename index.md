# AI in Self-Driving Cars

In the past, people thought that today's world would have flying cars. Now people in today's world think that the future will see self-driving cars. Is this idea a futuristic dream or an idea that will soon become a reality? Many cars now have embedded artificial intelligence, but what works well or causes problems? What can the future of self-driving cars hold, and what are the effects of implementing self-driving features through the use of AI in vehicles?

## Current State
Within the last 20 years, vehicle manufacturers have been developing features to make driving safer. However, human error still exists, so autonomous vehicle manufactorers have good reason to develop better AI for their cars. Distracted driving is a huge problem on the roads, but an autonomous vehicle cannot be distracted. Most people would consider a self-driving car to not require a person in the driver's seat, which is a point that has not been reached yet. However, many cars driven by a person could be considered partially autonomous. Newer cars often come with blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist, and other features that are possible because of an artificial intelligence component. These features, though much more subtle than a full autonomy, can help to prevent accidents. These features provide the driver with more knowledge of their surroundings, but the driver is still in control of the vehicle. There are also features like alerts for drivers who drift out of their lane multiple times in a given time period. The car is able to alert them to stay more awake. These features are a long ways away from a self-driving car, but they are a big step in the right direction. Tesla vehicles are much more advanced than cars with these features. Tesla cars are able to drive autonomously, but they still require a driver because they are still far from perfect.
